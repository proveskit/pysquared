# Getting Started

# Getting Started with PySquared

## Introduction

PySquared is a flight software library designed for building and deploying satellite systems using CircuitPython. The library is hardware agnostic, meaning it can be used with various CircuitPython-compatible boards but is designed to run on [PROVES](https://docs.proveskit.space/en/latest/) hardware. Like the PROVES hardware, PySquared is an education first software project. We're here to help you learn to develop and launch satellites so be sure to ask questions!

This guide will help you set up your development environment and get you started with building a satellite using the PySquared Flight Software.

## Setting Up Your Computer

Set up your development environment by following the instructions in your OS specific guide.

Linux Guide

Update your package list and install the necessary packages:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install make screen zip

```

MacOS Guide

1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**: These tools are necessary for compiling and building software.

   ```sh
   xcode-select --install

   ```

1. **Install Homebrew**: Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS. Follow the instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) to install it.

1. **Install Required Packages**: Open a terminal and run the following command to install required packages:

   ```sh
   brew install screen

   ```

Windows Guide

1. **Install Git**: Download and install the version control system [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Make sure to also install the Git Bash terminal during the setup process.

1. **Install Putty**: Download and install [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

1. **Install Chocolatey**: Download and install the Windows package manager [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install).

1. **Install Required Packages**: Open a command prompt or Git Bash terminal and run the following command to install required packages:

   ```sh
   choco install make rsync zip

   ```

Keep in mind that the rest of this guide expects that you are using Git Bash.

WSL Guide

Follow the steps in the Linux Guide

## Cloning Your Repository

Let's start by creating your own repository to host your satellite's software. You can use one of the PySquared template repositories to get started quickly. Find your board version below, visit the repository, and click "Fork" to create your own copy of the repository.

| Board Version | Proves Repo | | --- | --- | | v4 | [proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2040_v4](https://github.com/proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2040_v4) | | v5 | [proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2040_v5](https://github.com/proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2040_v5) | | v5a | [proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2350_v5a](https://github.com/proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2350_v5a) | | v5b | [proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2350_v5b](https://github.com/proveskit/CircuitPython_RP2350_v5b) |

Then you can clone your repository to your local machine using the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

```

Learn how to use the git command line

Next, change directory (`cd`) into the repo directory:

```sh
cd your-repository

```

You are now in your repo directory. This is where you'll write code that makes its way onto your satellite!

## Installing CircuitPython

CircuitPython May Already Be Installed

If you already have CircuitPython installed on your board, you can skip this section. You can check if CircuitPython is installed by plugging in your board and [trying to access the serial console](#accessing-the-serial-console).

Next, we need to install the latest CircuitPython firmware on your board. CircuitPython is a Python runtime for microcontrollers like the one on your board.

First you must find your board's TTY port. You can find the TTY port by plugging in your board and running the following command:

```sh
make list-tty

```

Example output:

```sh
TTY ports:
/dev/cu.usbmodem3101

```

In this example, the TTY port is `/dev/cu.usbmodem3101`. This is the port you will use to communicate with your board.

Seeing more than one TTY port?

If you see more than one TTY port listed, you may need to unplug your board and run the command again to see which one is created when you plug it in. The new port is likely the one you want.

Now you can install CircuitPython by running the following command:

```sh
make install-circuit-python BOARD_TTY_PORT=<tty_port>

```

## Installing PySquared

### Finding Your Board's Mount Point

Next, make sure your PROVES flight control board is plugged in and we'll find its mount point. The mount point is the location on your computer where the board's filesystem is accessible. This varies by operating system, so follow the guide for your OS below to find it.

Linux Guide

On linux you can use the `findmnt` command to locate your board's mount point.

```sh
findmnt
...
├─/media/username/SOME-VALUE /dev/sdb1 vfat rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime 0 0

```

In this example, the mount point is `/dev/sdb1`. Another common mount point for linux systems is `/media/username/<board_name>`.

MacOS Guide

On Mac, you can find the location of your mount by looking for a mount named `PYSQUARED`, `PROVESKIT` or `CIRCUITPYTHON` in your `/Volumes` directory

```sh
ls -lah /Volumes
...
drwx------@  1 nate  staff    16K Jan  9 08:09 PYSQUARED/

```

In this example, the mount point is `/Volumes/PYSQUARED/`.

Windows Guide

In Git Bash your mount point will be the letter of the drive location in windows. For example, if the board is mounted at `D:\` then your drive location for commands in Git Bash will be `/d/`.

WSL Guide

First you must follow the guides to [connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb "How to Connect USB to WSL") and [mount](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-mount-disk "How to Mount a Disk to WSL") your board in WSL.

After following those guides, your mount point will probably be the letter of the drive location in Windows with `/mnt/` prepended. For example, if the board is mounted at `D:\` then your mount point in WSL will likely be `/mnt/d/`. If you are unsure, you can check the available mount points by running `ls /mnt/` in your terminal.

### Running the Install Command

With the repository cloned and your boards mount point in hand you can now install the flight software to the board. Navigate to the root of your board specific repository and run:

```sh
make install-flight-software BOARD_MOUNT_POINT=<path_to_your_board>

```

Replace `<path_to_your_board>` with the mount point discovered in the previous section.

## Accessing the Serial Console

To see streaming logs and use the on-board repl you must access the Circuit Python serial console.

Remember the TTY port you found earlier? You will use that to connect to the board's serial console. The serial console allows you to interact with the board and see output from your code. If you don't remember the TTY port, you can run the `make list-tty` command again to find it.

Linux & MacOS Guide

You can then connect to the board using the `screen` command:

```sh
screen /dev/cu.usbmodem3101

```

For more information visit the [Circuit Python Serial Console documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-mac-and-linux).

Windows Guide

For information on how to access the serial console, visit the [Circuit Python Serial Console documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/advanced-serial-console-on-windows).

Warning

If all you see is a blank screen when you connect to the serial console, try pressing `CTRL+C` to see if you can get a prompt. If that doesn't work, try pressing `CTRL+D` to reset the board.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully installed PySquared and have started a serial console session to view the output from your flight control board! Now you can start your journey of building and launching satellites using CircuitPython and PySquared.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your development environment set up, you can start [exploring the PySquared library](../api/) and building on the repo you forked and cloned earlier in this guide.

# Radio Test

# PySquared Radio Test Documentation

When receiving a PROVES device, most teams want to set up a radio test to ensure that the radio is functioning correctly. This document provides a guide on how to set up and run a radio test using the PySquared framework. You will need two boards for this test: one to send data and one to receive data.

Radio License Required

Before running the radio test, ensure that you have the appropriate license to operate the radio frequencies used by the PROVES Kit. Failure to comply with local regulations may result in interference with other devices or legal issues.

## Setting Up the Radio Test

Just like in the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/), you will need to clone your board specific repository and make sure that [CircuitPython is installed](../getting-started/#installing-circuitpython) on both boards.

### Setting Up the Configuration

In the root of your board specific repository, you will find a `config.json`. Change the `radio.license` to your callsign or the callsign of the licensed individual you are operating under. This is important for compliance with radio regulations.

```json
{
  "radio": {
    "license": "YOUR_CALLSIGN"
  }
}

```

Next, you will need to install the flight control software on one board and the ground station software on the other. To do this, you'll need to [know your board's mount point](../getting-started/#finding-your-boards-mount-point).

### Flight Control Software Installation

On the first board, install the flight control software by running the following command:

```sh
make install-flight-software BOARD_MOUNT_POINT=<path_to_your_board>

```

### Ground Station Software Installation

On the second board, install the ground station software by running the following command:

```sh
make install-ground-station BOARD_MOUNT_POINT=<path_to_your_board>

```

### Running the Radio Test

Now, [open the serial console](../getting-started/#accessing-the-serial-console) for both boards. On the ground station board, use the console to send or receive messages to verify communication with the flight control board.
# Design Guide

# Design Guide

This document provides an overview of the design principles and architecture of the PySquared Flight Software. It is intended for developers who want to understand how the software is structured and how to contribute effectively.

## CircuitPython

PySquared is built on top of CircuitPython, which is a version of Python designed for microcontrollers. CircuitPython is a fork of MicroPython which adhears to a subset of the Python language specification. Python 3.4 syntax is supported with some additional features pulled from later releases such as type hinting.

### Resources

- [Python 3.4 Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/index.html)
- [Differences between MicroPython and Python](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/genrst/index.html#cpython-diffs)
- [Differences between CircuitPython and MicroPython](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/README.html#differences-from-micropython)
- [CircuitPython Shared Bindings Documentation](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/index.html)
- [CircuitPython Standard Libraries Documentation](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/library/index.html)
- [CircuitPython Design Guide](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html)

## Types and Type Checking

We use type hints throughout the PySquared codebase to ensure that our code is clear and maintainable. Type hints help us catch errors early and make it easier to understand the expected types of variables and function parameters.

We use [typeshed](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) stubs to provide more accurate type hints for CircuitPython, replacing the default Python standard library type hints. These CircuitPython-specific stubs are located in the `typeshed/` directory. This helps the typechecker catch compatibility issues with CircuitPython code before running it on a device.

We do not accept changes to files in the `pysquared/` directory that include lines ignoring the type checker (e.g., `# type: ignore`). The only exceptions are:

- **Upstream Fix in Progress:** If a type error is caused by a bug or limitation in an external dependency, you may ignore the line only when leaving a comment with a link to the issue or PR where it is fixed or a fix is in progress. A valid type hint might look like this:

  ```python
  some_variable = some_function()  # type: ignore  # PR https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/10603

  ```

If you encounter a type error, first consider if it can be resolved by improving your code's design. If you believe an exception is necessary, please reach out for assistance before proceeding.

Using the Typing Module

For more advanced type hinting we can use the Python standard library's `typing` module which was introduced in Python 3.5. This module provides a variety of type hints that can be used to specify more complex types, such as `List`, `Dict`, and `Optional`. CircuitPython does not support the `typing` module so we must wrap the import in a try/except block to avoid import errors. For example:

```python
try:
    from typing import List, Dict, Optional
except ImportError:
    pass

```

This pattern allows us to use type hints in our code while still being compatible with CircuitPython.

Additionally we cannot use `typing`'s `Any` type hint in CircuitPython. Instead, we can use `object` as a generic type hint.

## Protocols

Protocols are a way to define a set of methods that a class must implement. They are similar to interfaces in other programming languages or header files in C. Protocols allow us to define a contract for classes to follow, ensuring that they implement the required methods. CircuitPython does not support Protocols, so we use base classes to define our protocols where all required methods are implemented with `...` (Ellipsis). All classes that implement the protocol must override these methods. Protocols can be found in `pysquared/protos/`.

## Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for unit testing our code. We are designing software for spacecraft, so it is important that we have a robust testing framework to ensure our code is reliable and works as expected. We write tests for all of our code, and we run these tests automatically using GitHub Actions. We aim to have 100% test coverage for all of our code, which means that every line of code is tested by at least one test case.

## Documentation

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build our documentation. We write our documentation in Markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. We document our code using docstrings, which are special comments that describe the purpose and usage of a function or class. We also use type hints in our docstrings to provide additional information about the expected types of parameters and return values. Where it makes sense, add usage examples following [CommonMark fenced code blocks](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#fenced-code-blocks) to document how to use your code.

### Module Documentation

Start with a brief summary, followed by an optional extended description:

```python
"""This module provides utilities for parsing and validating telemetry data from spacecraft sensors.

It includes classes and functions for decoding sensor packets, verifying data integrity, and converting
raw readings into SI units for further analysis.
"""

```

### Class Documentation

Begin with a short description, a detailed explanation, and a practical usage example:

```python
"""The TelemetryParser class extracts and validates sensor readings from raw telemetry packets.

TelemetryParser handles packet decoding, error checking, and conversion to SI units. It is designed
for use in spacecraft flight software where reliable sensor data is critical.

**Usage:**
~~~python
from pysquared.telemetry import TelemetryParser

parser = TelemetryParser()
packet = b'\x01\x02\x03\x04'
reading = parser.parse(packet)
print(reading.timestamp, reading.acceleration)  # Output: 2024-06-01T12:00:00Z (0.0, 9.8, 0.0)
~~~
"""

```

### Function/Method Documentation

Include a description, argument details, return values, and any exceptions raised:

```python
"""
Validate a sensor reading and convert it to SI units.

Args:
    reading: Raw sensor reading with keys 'value' and 'unit'.
    sensor_type: Type of sensor (e.g., 'acceleration', 'temperature').

Returns:
    float: The validated reading in SI units.

Raises:
    KeyError: If required keys are missing from the reading.
    ValueError: If the reading value is out of expected range.
"""

```

## Sensor Readings

All sensor readings must be in SI units and stored in a structure that includes the time of the reading. Including the time of the reading is important for analysing sensor data and ensuring that processes such as detumbling and attitude control can be performed accurately.

The following table lists possible sensor properties, their corresponding types and units for common sensor readings. The table was pulled directly from the [CircuitPython Design Guide](https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html#sensor-properties-and-units):

| Property Name | Python Type | Units / Description | | --- | --- | --- | | acceleration | (float, float, float) | x, y, z meter per second² | | alarm | (time.struct, str) | Sample alarm time and frequency string | | CO2 | float | measured CO₂ in ppm | | color | int | RGB, eight bits per channel (0xff0000 is red) | | current | float | milliamps (mA) | | datetime | time.struct | date and time | | distance | float | centimeters (cm) | | duty_cycle | int | 16-bit PWM duty cycle | | eCO2 | float | equivalent/estimated CO₂ in ppm | | frequency | int | Hertz (Hz) | | angular velocity | (float, float, float) | x, y, z radians per second | | light | float | non-unit-specific light levels | | lux | float | SI lux | | magnetic | (float, float, float) | x, y, z micro-Tesla (uT) | | orientation | (float, float, float) | x, y, z degrees | | pressure | float | hectopascal (hPa) | | proximity | int | non-unit-specific proximity values | | relative_humidity | float | percent | | sound_level | float | non-unit-specific sound level | | temperature | float | degrees Celsius | | TVOC | float | Total Volatile Organic Compounds in ppb | | voltage | float | volts (V) | | weight | float | grams (g) |

Definitions for sensor readings can be found in `pysquared/sensors/`

Handling Sensor Reading Failures

Sensor reading failures must be expected and handled gracefully. If a sensor reading fails, the code should log an error message and return a default value (e.g., `0.0` for numeric readings or `None` for optional readings). This ensures that the system can continue to operate even if a sensor is temporarily unavailable. In the case of a sensor hanging, the attempt must time out and return a default value.

- [Android Position Sensor Documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_position)
- [Android Environment Sensor Documentation](https://developer.android.com/develop/sensors-and-location/sensors/sensors_environment)

## Dependency Management

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing our python development environment and dependencies. It allows us to define our dependencies in a `pyproject.toml` file and provides a consistent way to install and manage them across different environments. We use dependency groups to separate the dependencies needed for running on the satellite `pyproject.dependencies`, development `pyproject.dev`, and documentation `pyproject.docs`.

`uv` is downloaded and installed automatically when you use run `make` commands. Please see the <Makefile> or `make help` for more information on how to use `uv` to manage your development environment.

## Linting and Code Style

We use [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting our code. `ruff` is a fast, extensible linter that checks our code for errors and enforces specific coding standards and style. We use `ruff`'s [default configuration](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/tree/0.12.3?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration) with only one addition, isort (`-I`), for linting and formatting our code.

### Linting

`ruff` checks our code for errors following [pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/) logic.

### Code Style

By default `ruff`, enforces the [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) style with [a few deviations](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#style-guide) decided by `ruff` for formatting our code. Code formatting ensures that our code is consistent and easy to read.

## Error Handling

Error handling in PySquared is designed to be robust and predictable. We use standard `try...except` blocks to catch exceptions. When an exception is caught, it should be logged with the `logger.error()` or `logger.critical()` method. This ensures that we have a record of the error and can diagnose it later.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("An error occurred", err=e)

```

Custom exceptions should be used to represent specific error conditions in your code. This allows us to handle different types of errors in a more granular way. Custom exceptions should inherit from the built-in `Exception` class and should be named using the `Error` suffix.

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for specific error conditions."""
    pass

try:
    # Code that may raise a CustomError
except CustomError as e:
    logger.error("A custom error occurred", err=e)

```

When raising exceptions, always provide a clear and descriptive error message. This will help us understand the context of the error when it is logged.

```python
raise CustomError("This is a custom error message")

```

## Logging

The syntax for our logging module `logger` is based off the popular Python logger [`Loguru`](https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). We use the `logger` module to log messages at different levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`) throughout our code. This allows us to track the flow of execution and diagnose issues when they arise.

Logs are structured as JSON, which makes them easy to parse and analyze. When logging, you can include additional key-value pairs to provide context.

```python
logger.info("User logged in", user_id=123)

```

Code that raises an exception should log at the `error` level. Code that failed but is recoverable should log at the `warning` level. The `debug` level should be used to understand the flow of the program during development and debugging. The `info` level should be used for general information about the program's execution, such as startup, shutdown, and other important updates. `critical` should be used for serious errors that may prevent the satellite from continuing operation, requiring a restart.

## Configuration

Configuration management in PySquared is centralized in the `Config` class. This class is responsible for loading, validating, and providing access to all configuration settings, which are stored in a JSON file.

### Loading and Accessing Configuration

The `Config` class is initialized with the path to the configuration file. It parses the JSON and exposes the settings as attributes.

**Usage:**

```python
from pysquared.config import Config

# Initialize the config with the path to your settings file
config = Config("config.json")

# Access configuration values directly
print(f"Satellite Name: {config.cubesat_name}")
print(f"Sleep Duration: {config.sleep_duration} seconds")

```

### Updating Configuration

The `update_config` method allows for both temporary (in-memory) and permanent (persisted to the JSON file) changes to the configuration.

- **Temporary Updates:** Changes are only applied to the `Config` object in memory and will be lost on restart.
- **Permanent Updates:** Changes are written back to the configuration file.

```python
# Temporarily update the sleep duration
config.update_config("sleep_duration", 120, temporary=True)

# Permanently update the satellite's name
config.update_config("cubesat_name", "PyCubed", temporary=False)

```

### Validation

The `Config` class includes a validation schema to ensure that all configuration values are within expected ranges and of the correct type. Any attempt to set an invalid value will raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`. This helps prevent runtime errors due to misconfiguration.

### Radio Configuration

Radio-specific settings are managed by the `RadioConfig` class, which is a nested object within the main `Config` class.

## Imports

We use relative imports for all of our modules. This allows us to easily import pysquared into downstream libraries like our board specific repos. For example, if we have a module `pysquared.sensors.temperature`, we can import it in another module using:

```python
from .sensors.temperature import TemperatureSensor

```

## Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)

We use the `pysquared.nvm` module to manage non-volatile memory (NVM) on the flight control board. This module provides a way to store persistent data across reboots, such as error counters and other important state information. The NVM module includes a `Counter` class for counting events and a `Flag` class for storing boolean flags.
# Contributing Guide

# Contributing Guide

Welcome to the contributing guide for PySquared! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get you started with contributing to the repository.

### Setting up your code editor

#### Workspaces

Working with the PySquared repo is different from working with other Python repos because part of the repo is designed to run on CircuitPython (e.g. the flight software) while another part is designed to run on standard CPython (e.g. the tests and development tools). To make the development experience as smooth as possible, we use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) workspaces for python environment management, a CircuitPython specific [`typeshed`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/) to give developers accurate type information for CircuitPython code, and [`pyright`](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) configurations to control when the CircuitPython typeshed is loaded.

To experience the best development environment, we recommend using a code editor that supports [code workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspaces) such as VS Code. When you open up the PySquared repository in your editor, open the workspace file located at `pysquared.code-workspace` and click `Open Workspace`. This will reload VS Code into workspace mode.

When you're in workspace mode, your editor will be able to autocomplete and tell you if you have any type errors in your code for both CircuitPython and CPython.

Not using VS Code?

If you're using a different code editor and you have configured it to provide this functionality, please consider contributing a section to this guide to help others get set up.

#### Dev Containers

Every repository comes with a `.devcontainer` directory that contains configuration for a ready-to-use development environment. This environment includes all the necessary tools and dependencies to work on the repository. You can use any code editor that supports dev containers, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), to open the repository in a dev container.

### Testing custom versions of PySquared

If you're making a change to PySquared, you can test it in a board specific repository by installing a specific version of PySquared.

Start by pushing your PySquared changes to a branch in the pysquared repository. Then, you can install that version of PySquared in a board specific repository by running the following command:

```sh
PYSQUARED_VERSION=<version_commit_or_branch_name> make install-flight-software BOARD_MOUNT_POINT=<board_mount_point>

```

If you've forgotten how to find your board's mount point, the instructions are in the [Getting Started Guide](../getting-started/).

### Testing Documentation Changes

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build our documentation. If you make changes to the documentation, you can build and test it locally by running:

```sh
make docs

```

This will generate the documentation and serve it locally. You can then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the changes.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This repo has a continuous integration system using Github Actions. Anytime you push code to the repo, it will run a series of tests. If you see a failure in the CI, you can click on the details to see what went wrong.

### Common Build Failures

Here are some common build failures you might see and how to fix them:

#### Lint Failure

Every time you make a change in git, it's called a commit. We have a tool called a pre-commit hook that will run before you make each commit to ensure your code is safe and formatted correctly. If you experience a lint failure you can run the following to fix it for you or tell you what's wrong.

```sh
make fmt

```

#### Test Failure

To ensure our code works as we expect we use automated testing. If you're seeing a testing failure in your build, you can see what's wrong by running those tests yourself with:

```sh
make test

```

#### Type Checking Failure

We use a tool called pyright to check our code for type errors. An example of a type error is if you try to add a string and an integer together. Pyright will catch these errors before they cause problems in your code. If you see a type checking failure in your build, you can run the following command to see what the error is:

```sh
make typecheck

```
